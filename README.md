# INTELLIGENCE-DATABSE-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM
**RDBMS project report On Intelligence database**
Our software is a standalone software, which means
running the python file shared above will launch the
software, if you have python installed in your system along
with the dependency python library and your internet is
connected:
- tk or tkinter
- python-mysql-connector
- pillow
- numpy
You can install these libraries with help of pip on
windows/linux/macos. (mysql connector is installed with
package manager in tested arch based linux machines)
Our mysql database temporarily hosted online at
https://www.freemysqlhosting.net, if it is expired then this
wonâ€™t work, so in that case use this .sql file to import the
database somewhere
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_DX59FUJD8wmMUoKzv2
Zx_X7xTg9Ty3I/view?usp=sharing
and then change these variables inside .py file to your
own credentials.
